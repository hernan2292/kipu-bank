# KipuBank Smart Contract

A secure banking smart contract built on Ethereum that allows users to deposit and withdraw ETH through personal vaults with built-in security measures.

## üè¶ What does the contract do?

KipuBank is a decentralized banking contract that provides the following functionality:

- **Personal Vaults**: Each user has their own secure vault to store ETH
- **Controlled Deposits**: Users can deposit ETH with a global bank deposit cap
- **Limited Withdrawals**: Withdrawals are restricted to a maximum amount per transaction
- **Activity Tracking**: The contract tracks the total number of deposits and withdrawals

## üöÄ Deployment with Remix

### üìã Requirements

- Remix IDE (online)
- MetaMask or any Web3 wallet
- Sepolia testnet ETH (for testing)

### 1. **Access Remix IDE**
   Visit [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)

### 2. **Create the contract file**
   - In Remix, create a new file: `KipuBank.sol`
   - Copy the contract code from [contracts/KipuBank.sol](contracts/KipuBank.sol)
   - Paste it into the Remix editor

### 3. **Compile the contract**
   - Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab (left sidebar)
   - Select compiler version `0.8.30` or higher
   - Click "Compile KipuBank.sol"
   - Verify there are no errors

### 4. **Deploy the contract**
   - Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
   - Select Environment:
     - **Remix VM**: For local testing (no real ETH needed)
     - **Injected Provider - MetaMask**: For testnet deployment (requires Sepolia ETH)

### 5. **Set deployment parameters**
   Before deploying, you need to provide constructor parameters:
   - `_withdrawalLimit`: Maximum ETH withdrawable per transaction (in wei)
   - `_bankCap`: Maximum total ETH deposits allowed (in wei)

   **Example values:**
   - Withdrawal Limit: 1 ETH = `1000000000000000000`
   - Bank Cap: 100 ETH = `100000000000000000000`

### 6. **Execute deployment**
   - Click "Deploy" button
   - Confirm the transaction in MetaMask (if using testnet)
   - Wait for deployment confirmation

### 7. **Verify deployment**
   - Copy the deployed contract address
   - The contract will appear under "Deployed Contracts" section
